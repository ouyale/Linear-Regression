# Linear Regression Analysis in Python

This project demonstrates how to apply linear regression to explore and model the relationship between two continuous variables.  
It covers the full workflow: data cleaning, correlation analysis, model fitting, and statistical validation — all implemented in Python.

## Highlights
- Outlier detection and handling  
- Missing value treatment (listwise deletion)  
- Correlation and heatmap analysis  
- Linear regression via manual OLS and `scipy.stats.linregress`  
- Visualisation of model fit and performance metrics

## Results
The analysis shows a strong positive correlation (**r = 0.99**) and a coefficient of determination  
**R² = 0.975**, indicating an excellent linear fit between the variables.
